## 🎯 What It Solves

Organizations often adopt AI without validating:

- Data readiness  
- Governance structure  
- Operational risk  
- Accountability ownership  

This framework introduces structured validation gates **before AI adoption.**

AI implementation is treated as a **management decision — not a technology experiment.**

---

## 🧩 What It Includes

- Conditional decision pathways  
- Objective-based validation checkpoints  
- Risk & governance review stage  
- Pilot-before-scale safeguards  
- Responsible deployment conditions  

---

## 🏗 Framework Structure

The model follows a structured decision pathway:

1. Define Primary Business Objective  
2. Validate AI Justification Conditions  
3. Apply Implementation Safeguards  
4. Conduct Risk & Governance Check  
5. Pilot Before Scaling  
6. Confirm Responsible Deployment Conditions  

If any condition fails, **process optimization precedes technology adoption.**
