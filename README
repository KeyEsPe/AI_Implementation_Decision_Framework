# AI Implementation Decision Framework

A structured governance-first framework designed to help non-technical decision-makers determine whether and how AI should be implemented responsibly.

## 🎯 Purpose

This framework prevents premature AI adoption by introducing mandatory validation gates before deployment. It ensures:

- Business justification
- Data readiness
- Risk & governance validation
- Controlled pilot testing
- Responsible production deployment

AI implementation is treated as a management decision — not a technology experiment.

## 🧭 Framework Overview

The model follows a conditional decision pathway:

1. Define primary business objective
2. Validate AI justification conditions
3. Apply recommended implementation safeguards
4. Perform Risk & Governance check
5. Pilot before scaling
6. Confirm responsible deployment conditions

If any condition fails, process optimization precedes technology adoption.
